         Movie Recommendation System Using Sentiment Analysis From Microblogging Data
        </h1>
        <p>Recommendation systems (RSS) have garnered immense interest for 
            applications in e-commerce and digital media. Traditional approaches in RSs 
            include such as collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF) 
            through these approaches that have certain limitations, such as the necessity 
            of prior user history and habits for performing the task of recommendation. 
            To minimize the effect of such limitation, this article proposes a hybrid RS for 
            the movies that leverage the best of concepts used from CF and CBF along 
            with sentiment analysis of tweets from microblogging sites. The purpose to 
            use movie tweets is to understand the current trends, public sentiment, and 
            user response of the movie. Experiments conducted on the public database 
            have yielded promising results.

            <h3>Existing System:</h3>
            <p>
                The current Movie Recommendation model is not fully capable of delivering the estimated
                number of movies as expected. Another emerging problem is the factors considered in the
                predictive model. Few things can be described as actor names, genres, movie titles, and directors.
                These factors lead to successful movie predictions and provide more accurate results from the
                model.
                One of the biggest problems facing recommendation programs is that they need a lot of data to
                successfully make recommendations. A good recommendation system first requires object data
                (from the catalog or other method), in which case it should take and analyze user data (behavioral
                events), and then the magic algorithm using Sentiment Analysis does its job. Most user data is a
                recommendation system to work with, which strengthens the chances of getting good
                recommendations. But it can be a problem - to get good recommendations, you need more users, to
                get more data for recommendations.
                Another major reason for failure is not enough to change user preferences. The problem here is that 
                today the user may have some purpose when browsing. Additionally, if you are given a set of users 
                with their previous movie rating ratings, can we predict the rating they will respond to a movie they 
                have not rated before. To resolve this database found in Kaggle it needs to be updated regularly.

            <h3> Proposed System:  </h3>
            <p>
                This project uses content-based filters that will provide accurate results compared to various types such as
                shared filters, based on user reviews (values), and, it will suggest movies we have not seen at this point, but users
                like we have, and we like. To determine whether two users are comparing or not, this program looks at the movies of
                both viewers and how they evaluated them. To be effective, this type of recommendation requires standards, not all
                users calculating things continuously. Some of them are rare or even worthless! This leads to a cold launch problem:
                If there was another movie, no one else would like it or watch it, so you won't have this on your recommended list,
                even if you like it. Another feature of this process is the variation in recommendations, which may be lucky or
                unfortunate, depending on the case.
                On the other hand, content-based filters have proven to be effective, this type of filter does not involve different
                users but ourselves: It has no problem with cold startup because it uses attributes, such as characters, director
                name, genre, movie length, so our favorite movies are recommended immediately. By looking at what we like, the
                algorithm will simply select items similar to what we already like to recommend. In this case, there will be little
                variation in the recommendations, but this will apply whether user prices or not.
                This project uses content-based filters that will provide accurate results compared to various types such as shared
                filters, based on user reviews (values), and, it will suggest movies we have not seen at this point, but users like we
                have, and we like.
